Gang,

Here are the latest scores.

On a sad note, I learned yesterday that West Munz, Cheryl Ashe's partner, died unexpectedly. At this point, I left Cheryl a message asking how to contact the family and if there was anything I could do, etc. I have not heard back from her. So I know nothing about a service or anything else. At the least, I'll keep his wife in my thoughts.

Regards,

Bonnie
