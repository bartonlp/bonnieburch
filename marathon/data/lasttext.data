Hello all. Here are the marathon scores turned in to date.

Congrats to Jackie and Pat for a huge score recently - 5210. That includes two slams bid and made, and they are the only two reflected for the entire group.

Cold days offer great opportunities in warm homes to invite people in and play cards. Have fun.

By the way, everyone is paid up now so look forward to the party in June.

Bonnie
