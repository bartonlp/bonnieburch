Hello gang,

Barton updated our Marathon group info to reflect the changes, such as Cheryl Ashe dropping out and Ceil taking her place as well as Ann joining her husband Jerry.

Two teams have played in a session and wow, the Robinsons scored big. 

Since this is my third year to do this and since players routinely tell me they're not getting the scores, I'm asking everyone who gets this to confirm that they got it.

For instance, Bernie never gets them because for some reason, the emails go to her Spam folder. Therefore, I let her know I sent it and she goes to Spam and retrieves it. 

That's why I'm asking for feedback.

Cheers,

Bonnie
