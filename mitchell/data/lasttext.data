Hello all,

I just saw a post on Facebook from Megan with all the particulars for this coming Saturday. Since not everyone engages with FB, here they are:

Saturday, August 12, Baird Light Plant
Lunch at noon
Memorial afterward 
Casual attire including red, white, blue for TX Rangers and black, orange for OSU.

If you want to say a few words about Mark, you're welcome to do so. 

FYI, my three kids and I are arriving mid-afternoon the day before and staying at the crappy motel - America's Best Value (ha ha!!) - but always known to this family as the Baird Motel. Phone 325-854-2527.

I'm sure most everyone is coming Friday also, and Felix says he'll have stuff for sandwiches, etc. that night. It's possible there will be a card or two dealt and a few chips on the table. Just sayin'! Mark would approve.

Looking forward to seeing everyone and honoring Mark.

Love,  Bonnie
