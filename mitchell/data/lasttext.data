Felix,

You've said that you haven't received family emails in the past. That might be because you didn't let me know that you changed your email address. Please confirm that you got this.

To everyone else, all is good on this end. We're through the holidays, traveling and especially eating, and on to the new year. Considering your ages and infirmities, I hope all is as well as can be expected. We are.

We're a lucky bunch to still care enough about each other to stay in touch. Not many families share that treasure.

I love each and every one of you.

Bonnie
