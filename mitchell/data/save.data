Hello again,

Megan asked for info about the protrusion/growth on Felix's side. Here's the scoop:
About six months ago, he suffered a bout of the flu/a cold/whatever that prompted intense coughing - the worst he ever had. After that, a large mass protruded on his side at about waist level but caused no pain. He saw more than one doctor who diagnosed several non-malignant possibilities, including a hematoma.
Meanwhile, he was undergoing physical therapy for another issue where a technician asked him if he knew that the protrusion was actually his intestines poking out. He didn't, so he recently saw a surgeon who confirmed that diagnosis. Felix explained to the doc that he experienced zero pain and could even sleep on it with no problem. After hearing that, the doctor told him that the surgery required to fix it would be difficult and lengthy, and he didn't recommend it for a man Felix's age. So Felix went home and says he has no problem living with it.
All said, I find it disturbing that it took a PT technician to diagnose a problem of that magnitude while certified doctors dismissed as a "nothing burger." Says something about this country's medical situation, huh?
Hugs, Bonnie
